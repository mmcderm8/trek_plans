#Trek Plan

Trek Plan is a Ruby on Rails based application that helps people plan trips. I studied abroad in London in the spring of 2015 and while abroad my friends and I had the most difficult time planning trips together. Every place we visited was so new to us and we had little to no idea what we could do for fun in these amazing cities. That was where the inspiration came for Trek Plan.
