#Trek Plan

Trek Plan is a Ruby on Rails based application that helps people plan trips. I studied abroad in London in the spring of 2015 and while abroad my friends and I had the most difficult time planning trips together. Every place we visited was so new to us and we had little to no idea what we could do for fun in these amazing cities. That was where the inspiration came for Trek Plan.


* Ruby version: 2.2.5

* Incorporated 2 API's: Google Maps API and Yelp API.
* Used javascript when incorporated the API's.
* Used devise authentication service so that you know only your friends are commenting on your trips.
* Used TDD for my approach.
* On Yelp page, users type in a city they want to visit, then an activity to do in that city. Whether it is food, drinks, or a particular attraction, then once they search, markers populate the map where these events take place.
* The most difficult part of my project was having the yelp markers display on the google map.
* I also built a transit layer within my map, so you know how to get to a certain event using public transportation within that city.
* In the future, I would love to incorporate an Expedia API so that users can book flights and hotels straight from my application.
